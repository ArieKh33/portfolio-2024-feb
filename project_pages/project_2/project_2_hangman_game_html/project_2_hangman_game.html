After learning some basic PHP I received an exercise to make a fun game made with PHP and that would be the hangman game. It would also be a first in where I would work together with a classmate of mine.</p>

                    <h3>Playing the game</h3>
                    <p>After you've picked a random word or a word chosen yourself you can start playing, the letter amount will be shown first and underneath will be the hangman itself. To play the game and guess the letters there is a line of buttons from the entire alphabet, and you can start whenever you'd like.</p>

                    <h3>How to play the hangman game</h3>
                    <p>For the people who don't know how the hangman game works I will give a quick rundown. In the hangman game you receive a random word that you will have to guess, the only hint you'll receive at the start is the amount of characters the word consists of. And you start by guessing which letters are a part of that word, but be careful because every time you guess a letter not part of the word a portion of the drawing of the "hangman" will be drawn out, and when the drawing is finished you lose, however if you guess a letter correctly then it'll show the letter in the right position of the word and when you guess all the letters correctly you'll be victorious.</p>

                    <p>So you have started playing and you start guessing that the letter "A" is part of the word, since the letter hasn't filled any blank spot and having the hangman drawn out more shows that that letter is Incorrect. </p>
